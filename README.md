# job_search
this script scrapes different job-search-websites for job-titles which match a definable pattern (eg. 'data analyst'). The newly found jobs are compared to the job-masterlist. All new jobs which are not allready stored in the masterlist, will be stored in a new excel-file 'new_jobs.xlsx'.
